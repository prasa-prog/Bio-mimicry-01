ðŸ”‘ Key insight: Locusts attract mates using a combination of chemical signals (such as 4-vinylanisole, 4VA) and vibrational patterns. 
By replicating these natural mating frequencies, it is possible to influence or attract swarms.
In this project, Arduino is used as the medium to generate vibration patterns (through controlled signal outputs), simulating locust communication.
While Arduino serves as a prototype platform, the approach could be extended or adapted to other media or technologies depending on the application.

Good luck exploring further applications of this idea!
