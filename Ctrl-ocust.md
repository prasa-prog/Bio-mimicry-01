#Objective : Propose Novel Method for Locust Control.
##Approach : Bio-mimicry
##Language used : Arduino
#Methodology
As we all know locust attract females insects by emerging chemicals(ex: 4-vinylanisole), and noises unique frequencies in mating cyle.
By genertaing unique frequecy(most locusts are generating frequencies around 5kHz) of mating, 
Swarms can be directed certain enclosed area for managing purpose.
